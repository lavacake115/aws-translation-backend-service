# aws-translation-backend-service
This AWS project leverages a serverless architecture that uses the following AWS services:
- Amazon API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

These services will be used to create a translation backend service that utilizes the Python library "googletrans' (Google translate's API).
The only HTTP methods (CRUD operations) tested in this project are GET and POST methods to interact with the REST API endpoint.
